List fonts and colors SASS variables
======================

The default hotkey is <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>L</kbd> (or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>
+<kbd>L</kbd> on Linux to avoid conflicts with the lock screen hotkey).

Please note that the plugin currently does not understand variable scope and therefore will display all
the occurances of a variable.
